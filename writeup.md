## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

***Answer 1: The most common sentiment observed in the sample of 50 reviews was the "negative" sentiment. The chart supports this claim with nearly 28 reviews being negative. This means that majority of customers from 1999-2012 had a negative experience with the Zico Coconut Water product.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

***Answer 2
The labels appear to be fairly reliable. For reviews that clearly fall on either end of the spectrum with both positive and negative words or phrases such as "ugly", "not buy", "disappointed", "love this", "my favorite" and many more were correctly labled and marked as either positive or negative. 
However, for certain reviews that had mixed sentiments, it was slighlty difficult for the model to accurately predict and was labeled as either positive or negative. 
Model hallucinations introduce risks which could skew the results. For example, the model lacks cultural context or sarcasm training, so certain reviews from people from different backgrounds could be misinterpreted and skew the result a certain way. 

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

***Answer 3:
Given that the main review is overwhelemingly negative, the Cocunut Water Producer would need to come up with a new strategy. 

From the negative reviews, customers focused on two things, the taste and the packaging. There were multiple complaints about plastic taste, from concentrate tatse and the plastic packaging. Given that the reviews were quite detailed, the company can work towards addressing the customer needs. They can start by offerring a non -concentrate option. They can also change the packaging to a more sustainable friendly which meets their customer's demands and gives them a sustainability angle to lean on for their business. Addressing these issues, allows the business to improve their product and retain more customers.
